      <description><![CDATA[The original Bilt card holds a unique place in my wallet as the only product that effectively gamified housing expenses. However, as the company transitions to its 'Bilt Card 2.0' model, the exceptional value of those early days appears to be over.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I escaped graduate school for a luxury spring break in Thailand by using 120,000 Hilton points to book the Cape Kudu Hotel. This stay was worth $1,400 in cash, but I secured it for free by leveraging the "5th Night Free" perk and a sign-up bonus from my Hilton Surpass card. My Gold status also provided me with great benefits like a room upgrade, daily breakfast, and a private longboat excursion.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Organizing a two-week NSF-funded summer school is a ton of work. Why not route those reimbursable purchases through the right cards and earn points as a “payout” for the effort?

That’s exactly what I did at Rossbypalooza. Every dollar was reimbursed, I didn’t change my personal budget, and I still walked away with a points haul that turned into a $1,000+ flight. Here’s the exact playbook and the math.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I booked an 11-hour Qatar Airways Qsuite flight that sells for around $3,200… for 62,000 Chase points + ~$200 in fees. Same route (Seoul → Doha → Milan), same lie-flat luxury, but paid like a grad student. Here’s exactly how I pulled it off (and how you can too).]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Most U.S. airport lounges are just a crowded waiting room with sad snacks. The Capital One Lounge at DFW is the rare exception: genuinely good food, La Colombe coffee, grab-and-go for your flight, showers, and yes, a Peloton. Here’s why it’s worth going out of your way for, plus the exact tips to actually get in when the lines get brutal.]]></description>
